## 🚀 Deployment to GitHub Pages

### Automatic Deployment

This project is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions.

#### Setup Steps:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages:**
   - Go to your repository settings
   - Navigate to "Pages" section
   - Under "Source", select "GitHub Actions"

2. **Push to main branch:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Deploy to GitHub Pages"
   git push origin main
   ```

3. **Check deployment:**
   - Go to the "Actions" tab in your repository
   - Wait for the deployment workflow to complete
   - Your site will be available at `https://yourusername.github.io/PayoneerCalc/`

### Manual Deployment

If automatic deployment doesn't work, you can manually deploy:

1. Build the project:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. The built files will be in the `dist` folder
3. Push these files to the `gh-pages` branch or upload them manually

## 🔧 Configuration

- **Development**: Uses Vite proxy for CORS
- **Production**: Uses AllOrigins CORS proxy service
- **Base URL**: Configured for GitHub Pages at `/PayoneerCalc/`

## Fetching exchange-rate error fix

The failure was caused by the production fetch using a blocked proxy path from GitHub Pages.
I replaced it with a direct public exchange-rate API and normalized the response to the app’s expected shape in src/services/exchangeRate.ts.

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

If the GitHub Pages site shows a 404 error:

1. Check that GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
2. Ensure the source is set to "GitHub Actions"
3. Check the Actions tab for deployment status
4. Wait a few minutes after deployment completes
